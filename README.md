# Welcome!

This assignment is built with React Native + Expo. <br>
This assignment was also tested with an iPhone 15 Pro (Physical Device) and Android Emulator Pixel 9 Pro API 35. <br>
This is also my first time building an app with React Native and I learn it as I go along doing this assignment. <br>
Due to the time constraint, I was prioritizing the features instead of putting too much effort on the design. <br><br>

I hope you can understand if there are any areas where I may not have performed perfectly. <br>
Thank you so much for your time and the opportunity given to me! <br>
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start -c
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

#### _NOTE: Biometric Authentication may not work as expected in this project as it requires the app to get distributed to app store, which I don't have the resource to do it. However, you will still be able to get authenticated with enter your passcode for testing purposes._
