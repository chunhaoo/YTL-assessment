# Welcome!

This assignment is built with React Native + Expo. <br>
This assignment also tested with an iPhone 15 Pro (Physical Device) and Android Emulator Pixel 9 Pro API 35. <br>
This is also my first time buidling app with React Native and I learn it as I go along doing this assignment. <br>
Due to the time constraint, I was prioritizing the features instead of putting too much efforts on the design. <br><br>

I hope you can understand if there are any areas where I may not have performed perfectly. <br>
Thank you so much for your time and the opportunity given to me! <br>
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!

## Get started

1. Install dependencies
